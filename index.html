                                            <h1>Dear Young Dreamer,</h1>
                                             i end of the school year is at kariba sinior secondry on the air. Your attention wanders in these final days of lectures, homework, and classroom chatter and trust me, I understand why. Though I’ve graduated through life into “adult status,” I remember the keen yearning to spend my days hunting through the yard, chasing my brothers, and feeling the sugary slide of Gatorade wash away the heat. Or in truth, if we’re talking about my high school years, the yearning to sleep until noon. And though you can no doubt appreciate this notion of summers spent simply hanging out with friends, your emails to me indicate you’re already looking farther ahead.

                                            Your thoughts are jumbled right now with the woes of your teenage years, and though you are on the cusp of adulthood yourself, you’re not there yet. Which means you war with the twin duties assigned to you: honor your childhood now, and yet plan for your future. You dream of being a pop star, of being the next president, of being a nurse-lawyer-architect. You haven’t told me specifically what you want but I know it will likely change several times over the coming years. And sometimes I know you dream of just getting through it, for even the most idyllic childhood has its obstacles, and yours was far from idyllic.</p>

                                          
                                        </p>

                                        I travelled to six countries in africa before reaching europe, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad and finally Libya.
                                        Let’s shift back to right now Young Dreamer, because your quandary has you discouraged and has you believing travel is unattainable.

                                       I once thought that too. I once thought long-term travel was reserved for the rich, for the clever, for the people who had something I lacked. I lived in a place of seeking permission, of looking around at my peers—my best friends and those in my classes—and assuming what they strived for was also my ceiling. That if none of them dreamed of traveling surely it was out of reach me too.

                                       The hardest task you have ahead of you is to push through the naysayers, to look beyond the rules and permissions society places upon because of your color, class, gender, or age and to realize that if you dream it—if you hold something in your heart that you want to do, then there is validity and goodness in that choice.

                                      You are frustrated now, to look around you and see the limitations and all the reasons you can’t travel right this instant, but one day that will change and it  will be solely up to you to look at your circumstances and believe that you can make long-term travel happen. Grasp tightly to the belief that you will take a gap year abroad, or leave on a mission trip for a year, that you might study during college at some of the wonderful international universities or find a job  that lets you work abroad.

                                         <h1>It is my deepest wish that i never do.</h1>
                                          I moved to Berlin to try my luck here.
                                         know it will grow well, you will fall in love with people, with new ideas, and if you’re lucky with a line of work that brings you some measure of joy. The beauty of travel though, is that it’s a dream that can run alongside the others, and one that’s never fully realized, for there are ever more corners of the world to see, foods to taste, and people to meet. So though I could have prefaced this letter with the acknowledgement that dreams shift and change—for that is the absolute truth—it is my hope that together we can light a spark for travel that will carry you through the coming years and out into the world.

                                         And now you’re wondering if I’m crazy and carried away, I tend to move easily into “ramble mode” (just ask my niece, she’s subjected to these whims of thought often enough). But the truest lesson I can share with you is that traveling young will change the course of your life. The desire to travel goes deeper than a flippant answer to the question “What do you want to do when you grow up?” Travel is not an answer to any question, but rather the path you will take to arrive at an answer that is more honest and true to who you are and what you are meant to do.

                                        jumpingYou’re in an in-between land, caught between a child and adult; it’s a lovely and strange place. It’s a time when you are given the task by life to figure out who you are. Can  I be frank in saying that on the verge of turning 30 this year, I still don’t have an answer. Actually, every time I think I do, it changes … which is, perhaps, the lesson here. I wish someone had told me then that who you are evolves and changes with every new experience, with each tragedy you will face, and with the obstacles you will overcome, and the things you discover that bring you joy.</p>

                                        Rough as life can be, even for a child, I so hope you hold tight to this dream to travel. At no other point in your life will society give the permission to dream like you can now. And though you don’t need that permission, though the very notion of someone else codifying your life based on their life is false, though I urge you to fight against those people in the coming years who ask you to conform, for now you are still young, still subject to the will and best interests of those who love you. There is good and rightness in that too.</p>

                                            Now may truly not be your time to travel, for so many factors play into this part of your life—parents, money, family politics, national politics, education—the list is long. But in accepting the validity of your decision we can start to look at options, we can explore the world from the perspective that you—be you poor or rich, troubled or not—that someone in exactly your situation can travel someday. All you need to know is that it is possible, and from there we’ll find the opportunities to make it happen.

                                            In fact, I am of the belief that as we accept a decision, we begin to see opportunities that we never before noticed.

                                            And in that spirit Young Dreamer, with a summer of freedom ahead of you, I leave you with some practical ideas that may just take you closer to your dreams. Some won’t be right for you, you might hate a couple of them, and a couple definitely need to be discussed with your parents, but just maybe one will spark an idea that gives you one nudge closer to bringing travel into your life.</p>
